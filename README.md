# WebSphere-Classic-Custom-encoding-sample
sample and doc

This project includes sample program and a setup word doc for WebSphere classic custom encoding.  It is created and tested using WebSphere v6.1. It seems to work for v7, v8, v8.5 and v8.5.5.  

When you compile your code, please set classpath to the right version of runtime jar.  

Suggestions and comments are welcome.  Also if you get to try it out and see updates are needed, please request change via GitHub.  

Thanks!
